# telegram-pusher

This is some dumb thing that will take messages from telegram
and relay through https://pusher.com to a web application.

I've provided a simple PHP script that does a channel thing to
show a "notification". On my Nexus 6P, if the phone is unlocked,
and the page is still loaded while Chrome is in memory, the alert
will bring the user to my notification page
